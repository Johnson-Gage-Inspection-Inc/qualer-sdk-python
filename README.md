# qualer-sdk-python

This repository contains the Python client for the Qualer API. This package was automatically generated by [Swagger Codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen), and it provides client classes and models for interacting with the Qualer API.

## Features

- **Auto-generated Client:** Based on your [spec.json](spec.json) by using the Swagger Codegen CLI.
- **Multiple Python Versions:** Compatible with Python 2.7 and Python 3.4+.
- **Extensive API Coverage:** See the [API Documentation](docs/) for details on available endpoints and models.

## Installation

You can install the package using either `pip` or `setuptools`.

### Using pip

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/Johnson-Gage-Inspection-Inc/qualer-sdk-python.git
```

### Using setuptools

```sh
python setup.py install --user
```

## Usage

After installing, import and use the package in your Python code:

```python
import qualer_sdk

# Initialize the API client
api_client = qualer_sdk.ApiClient()
# Example: call the Account API
account_api = qualer_sdk.api.account_api.AccountApi(api_client)
response = account_api.account_login(...)
print(response)
```

For more details on each API, refer to the generated [API documentation](docs/).

## Prerequisites

### Java Requirement

To regenerate the SDK, you must have Java installed on your system. The `regenerate_sdk.py` script uses the Swagger Codegen CLI, which requires Java (version 8 or higher).

- **Download Java:**
  - [Oracle JDK Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
  - [Adoptium OpenJDK](https://adoptium.net/)
- **Verify Installation:**
  - After installing, verify Java is available by running the following command in your terminal:
    ```sh
    java -version
    ```
  - You should see output indicating the installed Java version.
- **Troubleshooting:**
  - If you see an error like `'java' is not recognized as an internal or external command`, ensure Java is added to your system's PATH environment variable. See [How to set JAVA_HOME in Windows](https://www.baeldung.com/java-home-on-windows-7-8-10-mac-os-x-linux) for guidance.

## Regenerating the SDK

If you need to update or regenerate the SDK based on a new specification:

```sh
python regenerate_sdk.py
```

This script uses the [swagger-codegen-cli-2.4.21.jar](swagger-codegen-cli-2.4.21.jar) along with [spec.json](spec.json).

## Running Tests

The repository includes tests for various API endpoints. You can run the tests using `nosetests`:

```sh
nosetests
```
